The second version of my portfolio website. Made pretty much right when I started learning javascript during my sophomore year at UT. I clearly had no idea what I was doing!

There was some fun stuff here. The scrolling image on the right side reacted to buttons pressed on the gameboy. Also I wrote my first iteration of w0rm, which is basically Snake with portals. Code was a mess, but it worked! It was accessible by either entering the konami code using the gameboy on the left side or by clicking a link in the "Projects" section (boring!).

Looks like this:
